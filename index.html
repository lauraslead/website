      <h2>Cristina & Greta</h2>
    <span class="quote">“We are so happy that we have Laurita to take Greta out as she is so caring with her and also so patient. Our dog loves the time with her and comes back happy and knackered! Which it is rare in a Jack Russel! We highly recommend Laurita as you not only get a dog walker but also someone that really cares about dogs and personalises the time she gives to them.”</span>

      <h2>Bron & Chewie</h2>
    <span class="quote">“Laura is excellent. Really professional and very personable. She clearly loves working with dogs and in two walks a week over the past few weeks, I’ve already seen my very reactive Shih Tzu become much more manageable. I even took her to a coffee shop where there were other dogs today and she paid a lot more attention to me, she did really well!”</span>
